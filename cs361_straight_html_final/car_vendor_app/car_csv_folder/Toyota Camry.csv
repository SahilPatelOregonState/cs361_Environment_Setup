6418ec61cda65fe10e914f3c,Toyota Camry,The Toyota Camry (/ˈkæmri/; Japanese: トヨタ・カムリ Toyota Kamuri) is an automobile sold internationally by the Japanese auto manufacturer Toyota since 1982, spanning multiple generations. Originally compact in size (narrow-body), the Camry has grown since the 1990s to fit the mid-size classification (wide-body)—although the two widths co-existed in that decade. Since the release of the wide-bodied versions, Camry has been extolled by Toyota as the firm's second \"world car\" after the Corolla. As of 2022[update], the Camry is positioned above the Corolla and below the Avalon or Crown in several markets.\n,https://www.motoringresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Toyota_Camry.jpg,0
